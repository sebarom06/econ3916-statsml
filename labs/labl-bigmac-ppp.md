# Lab 1: Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

## 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Empirical examination of the Law of One Price using The Economist's Big Mac Index as a proxy for international price levels and currency valuation.

## 🎯 Economic Context

This analysis leverages "Burgernomics" - the use of Big Mac prices across countries as a standardized basket of goods - to test whether purchasing power parity (PPP) holds in practice. Under the Law of One Price, identical goods should cost the same across countries when expressed in a common currency, absent trade barriers and transaction costs.

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Data Construction**: Manually constructed a structured dataset using Python dictionaries based on The Economist's 2015 Big Mac Index data
- **PPP Calculation**: Computed implied PPP exchange rates by comparing local Big Mac prices to US baseline prices
- **Valuation Analysis**: Calculated percentage over/undervaluation of currencies relative to the US Dollar by comparing implied PPP rates with actual market exchange rates
- **Technical Implementation**: Leveraged Python and Pandas for data manipulation and economic indicator derivation

## 💡 Key Findings

**[Insert your specific findings here - example below:]**

The analysis revealed significant deviations from purchasing power parity:
- The Norwegian Krone was overvalued by approximately X%, suggesting Big Macs are relatively expensive in Norway
- [Currency Y] was undervalued by Z%, indicating potential arbitrage opportunities under the Law of One Price framework
- These disparities reflect real-world factors including labor costs, taxes, regulatory environments, and non-tradable service components in Big Mac production

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Data structuring and ingestion in Python
- Pandas DataFrame manipulation
- Economic indicator calculation (PPP, currency valuation metrics)
- Application of international economics theory to real-world data
